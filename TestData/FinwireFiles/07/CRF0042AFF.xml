	<newstext><![CDATA[The filing of Tesofensine for approval of obesity in Mexico by partner Medix is an important and positive milestone for Saniona, in our view. We expect potential approval in 2020 and launch in 2021. <br/><br/>We maintain a risk-adjustment of 90%. Our valuation range, based on a DCF approach, is nudged up by SEK 1 per share to SEK 45-54 due to NPV time value in the model. We also note that a new CEO has been onboarded, and hence that the current CEO Jorgen Drejer will continue in the role as CSO. The new CEO, Rami Levin, comes from a position as President, North America for SOBI and has significant commercial experience within rare disease.<br/><br/>Länk till uppdragsanalys:]]></newstext>
