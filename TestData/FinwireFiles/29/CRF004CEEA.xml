	<newstext><![CDATA[Founded in 2015 - market share already at 11%<br/>We initiate coverage on 24Storage, a real estate company focusing on self-storage in the Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö region. 24Storage was founded in 2015 with the vision to digitize the self-storage industry and today its consumer offering is permeated by digital solutions. The company has become the second-largest self-storage operator with a market share of 11%. It has a clear-cut strategy to expand in the Swedish market by opening 10,000sqm of lettable storage area p.a. We have not found a similar strategy among its peers (Shurgard, Pelican, Self Storage Group), which is why we argue that 24Storage will increase its market share and strengthen its position.<br/><br/>NOI CAGR of ~76% driven by improved occupancy rate<br/>We expect that rental income will grow by a CAGR of ~29%, driven by 1) new premises of ~10,000sqm p.a., 2) ‘20e-22e, rental income/sqm improving to market levels of SEK 2,350sqm in ’22e (SEK 1,910sqm in ’19) and 3) the group’s occupancy improving from 67% to 78%, which is close to the market figure of 81%. The improved rental income/sqm and occupancy imply that the NOI margin increases from ~14% in ‘19 to 36% in ‘22e, for a CAGR of ~76%. However, we expect that central admin costs and net financials will exceed the NOI, making the cash earnings negative in ’20-‘22e and consequently EPRA NAVPS only grows by a ~1% CAGR in the period, from SEK 39 to SEK 40.<br/><br/>P/EPRA NAVPS of 109% vs. historical average at 112%<br/>24Storage is trading at a P/EPRA NAVPS of 109%, which is below its historical average of 112%. On ‘20e, we arrive at EPRA NAVPS of SEK 38.4, down 2% y-o-y. We base our valuation range on a P/EPRA NAVPS of 0.8x-1.4x, which corresponds to 24Storages’s historical min. and max multiples. Given our ‘20e NAVPS and P/EPRA NAVPS multiple range, we arrive at a valuation of SEK 31-54 per share.]]></newstext>
